Jitsi Meet API
============

You can use Jitsi Meet API to create Jitsi Meet video conferences with custom GUI.

Installation
==========

To embed Jitsi Meet API in your application you need to add Jitsi Meet API library

```html
<script src="https://meet.jit.si/libs/lib-jitsi-meet.min.js"></script>
```

Now you can access Jitsi Meet API trough the `JitsiMeetJS` global object.

Components
=========

Jitsi Meet API has the following components:

* JitsiMeetJS

* JitsiConnection

* JitsiConference

* JitsiTrack

* JitsiTrackError

Usage
======
JitsiMeetJS
----------
You can access the following methods and objects trough `JitsiMeetJS` object.


*  `JitsiMeetJS.init(options)` - this method initialized Jitsi Meet API.
The `options` parameter is JS object with the following properties:
    - `useIPv6` - boolean property
    - `disableAudioLevels` - boolean property. Enables/disables audio levels.
    - `disableSimulcast` - boolean property. Enables/disables simulcast.
    - `enableWindowOnErrorHandler` - boolean property (default false). Enables/disables attaching global onerror handler (window.onerror).
    - `disableThirdPartyRequests` - if true - callstats will be disabled and the callstats API won't be included.
    - `enableAnalyticsLogging` - boolean property (default false). Enables/disables analytics logging.
    - `externalStorage` - Object that implements the Storage interface. If specified this object will be used for storing data instead of `localStorage`.
    - `callStatsCustomScriptUrl` - (optional) custom url to access callstats client script
    - `disableRtx` - (optional) boolean property (default to false).  Enables/disable the use of RTX.
    - `disabledCodec` - the mime type of the code that should not be negotiated on the peerconnection.
    - `preferredCodec` the mime type of the codec that needs to be made the preferred codec for the connection.
    - `disableH264` - __DEPRECATED__. Use `disabledCodec` instead.
    - `preferH264` - __DEPRECATED__. Use `preferredCodec` instead.

* `JitsiMeetJS.JitsiConnection` - the `JitsiConnection` constructor. You can use that to create new server connection.

* `JitsiMeetJS.setLogLevel` - changes the log level for the library. For example to have only error messages you should do:
```javascript
JitsiMeetJS.setLogLevel(JitsiMeetJS.logLevels.ERROR);
```

* `JitsiMeetJS.createLocalTracks(options, firePermissionPromptIsShownEvent)` - Creates the media tracks and returns them trough `Promise` object. If rejected, passes `JitsiTrackError` instance to catch block.
    - `options` - JS object with configuration options for the local media tracks. You can change the following properties there:
        1. `devices` - array with the devices - "desktop", "video" and "audio" that will be passed to GUM. If that property is not set GUM will try to get all available devices.
        2. `resolution` - the prefered resolution for the local video.
        3. `constraints` - the prefered encoding properties for the created track (replaces 'resolution' in newer releases of browsers)
        4. `cameraDeviceId` - the deviceID for the video device that is going to be used
        5. `micDeviceId` - the deviceID for the audio device that is going to be used
        6. `minFps` - the minimum frame rate for the video stream (passed to GUM)
        7. `maxFps` - the maximum frame rate for the video stream (passed to GUM)
        8. `desktopSharingFrameRate`
           - `min` - Minimum fps
           - `max` - Maximum fps
        9. `desktopSharingSourceDevice` - The device id or label for a video input source that should be used for screensharing.
        10. `facingMode` - facing mode for a camera (possible values - 'user', 'environment')
    - firePermissionPromptIsShownEvent - optional boolean parameter. If set to `true`, `JitsiMediaDevicesEvents.PERMISSION_PROMPT_IS_SHOWN` will be fired when browser shows gUM permission prompt.

* `JitsiMeetJS.createTrackVADEmitter(localAudioDeviceId, sampleRate, vadProcessor)` - Creates a TrackVADEmitter service that connects an audio track to a VAD (voice activity detection) processor in order to obtain VAD scores for individual PCM audio samples.
    - `localAudioDeviceId` - The target local audio device.
    - `sampleRate` - Sample rate at which the emitter will operate. Possible values  256, 512, 1024, 4096, 8192, 16384. Passing other values will default to closes neighbor, i.e. Providing a value of 4096 means that the emitter will process bundles of 4096 PCM samples at a time, higher values mean longer calls, lowers values mean more calls but shorter.
    - `vadProcessor` - VAD Processors that does the actual compute on a PCM sample.The processor needs to implement the following functions:
        - `getSampleLength()` - Returns the sample size accepted by calculateAudioFrameVAD.
        - `getRequiredPCMFrequency()` - Returns the PCM frequency at which the processor operates .i.e. (16KHz, 44.1 KHz etc.)
        - `calculateAudioFrameVAD(pcmSample)` - Process a 32 float pcm sample of getSampleLength size.
* `JitsiMeetJS.enumerateDevices(callback)` - __DEPRECATED__. Use `JitsiMeetJS.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices(callback)` instead.
* `JitsiMeetJS.isDeviceChangeAvailable(deviceType)` - __DEPRECATED__. Use `JitsiMeetJS.mediaDevices.isDeviceChangeAvailable(deviceType)` instead.
* `JitsiMeetJS.isDesktopSharingEnabled()` - returns true if desktop sharing is supported and false otherwise. NOTE: that method can be used after `JitsiMeetJS.init(options)` is completed otherwise the result will be always null.
* `JitsiMeetJS.getActiveAudioDevice()` - goes through all audio devices on the system and returns information about one that is active, i.e. has audio signal. Returns a Promise resolving to an Object with the following structure:
    - `deviceId` - string containing the device ID of the audio track found as active.
    - `deviceLabel` - string containing the label of the audio device.
* `JitsiMeetJS.getGlobalOnErrorHandler()` - returns function that can be used to be attached to window.onerror and if options.enableWindowOnErrorHandler is enabled returns the function used by the lib. (function(message, source, lineno, colno, error)).

* `JitsiMeetJS.mediaDevices` - JS object that contains methods for interaction with media devices. Following methods are available:
    - `isDeviceListAvailable()` - returns true if retrieving the device list is supported and false - otherwise
    - `isDeviceChangeAvailable(deviceType)` - returns true if changing the input (camera / microphone) or output (audio) device is supported and false if not. `deviceType` is a type of device to change. Undefined or 'input' stands for input devices, 'output' - for audio output devices.
    - `enumerateDevices(callback)` - returns list of the available devices as a parameter to the callback function. Every device is a MediaDeviceInfo object with the following properties:
        - `label` - the name of the device
        - `kind` - "audioinput", "videoinput" or "audiooutput"
        - `deviceId` - the id of the device

    - `getAudioOutputDevice()` - returns currently used audio output device id, '' stands for default device.
    - `isDevicePermissionGranted(type)` - returns a Promise which resolves to true if user granted permission to media devices. `type` - 'audio', 'video' or `undefined`. In case of `undefined` will check if both audio and video permissions were granted.
    - `addEventListener(event, handler)` - attaches an event handler.
    - `removeEventListener(event, handler)` - removes an event handler.

JitsiTrack
======
The object represents single track - video or audio. They can be remote tracks ( from the other participants in the call) or local tracks (from the devices of the local participant).
We have the following methods for controling the tracks:

1. `getType()` - returns string with the type of the track( "video" for the video tracks and "audio" for the audio tracks)


2. `mute()` - mutes the track. Returns Promise.

   Note: This method is implemented only for the local tracks.

3. `unmute()` - unmutes the track. Returns Promise.

   Note: This method is implemented only for the local tracks.

4. `isMuted()` - check if track is muted

5. `attach(container)` - attaches the track to the given container.

6. `detach(container)` - removes the track from the container.

7. `dispose()` - disposes the track. If the track is added to a conference the track will be removed. Returns Promise.

   Note: This method is implemented only for the local tracks.

8. `getId()` - returns unique string for the track.

9. `getParticipantId()` - returns id(string) of the track owner

   Note: This method is implemented only for the remote tracks.

10. `setAudioOutput(audioOutputDeviceId)` - sets new audio output device for track's DOM elements. Video tracks are ignored.

11. `getDeviceId()` - returns device ID associated with track (for local tracks only)

12. `isEnded()` - returns true if track is ended

13. `setEffect(effect)` - Applies the effect by swapping out the existing MediaStream on the JitsiTrack with the new

    MediaStream which has the desired effect. "undefined" is passed to this function for removing the effect and for

    restoring the original MediaStream on the `JitsiTrack`.

    The following methods have to be defined for the effect instance.

    `startEffect()` - Starts the effect and returns a new MediaStream that is to be swapped with the existing one.

    `stopEffect()` - Stops the effect.

    `isEnabled()` - Checks if the local track supports the effect.

    Note: This method is implemented only for the local tracks.

JitsiTrackError
======
The object represents error that happened to a JitsiTrack. Is inherited from JavaScript base `Error` object,
so `"name"`, `"message"` and `"stack"` properties are available. For GUM-related errors,
exposes additional `"gum"` property, which is an object with following properties:
 - `error` - original GUM error
 - `constraints` - GUM constraints object used for the call
 - `devices` - array of devices requested in GUM call (possible values - "audio", "video", "screen", "desktop", "audiooutput")

Getting Started
==============

1. The first thing you must do in order to use Jitsi Meet API is to initialize `JitsiMeetJS` object:

```javascript
JitsiMeetJS.init();
```

2. Then you must create the connection object:


```javascript
var connection = new JitsiMeetJS.JitsiConnection(null, null, options);
```


3. Now we can attach some listeners to the connection object and establish the server connection:

```javascript
connection.addEventListener(JitsiMeetJS.events.connection.CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED, onConnectionSuccess);
connection.addEventListener(JitsiMeetJS.events.connection.CONNECTION_FAILED, onConnectionFailed);
connection.addEventListener(JitsiMeetJS.events.connection.CONNECTION_DISCONNECTED, disconnect);

connection.connect();
```

4. After you receive the `CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED` event you are to create the `JitsiConference` object and
also you may want to attach listeners for conference events (we are going to add handlers for remote track, conference joined, etc. ):


```javascript
room = connection.initJitsiConference("conference1", confOptions);
room.on(JitsiMeetJS.events.conference.TRACK_ADDED, onRemoteTrack);
room.on(JitsiMeetJS.events.conference.CONFERENCE_JOINED, onConferenceJoined);
```

5. You also may want to get your local tracks from the camera and microphone:
```javascript
JitsiMeetJS.createLocalTracks().then(onLocalTracks);
```

NOTE: Adding listeners and creating local streams are not mandatory steps.

6. Then you are ready to create / join a conference :

```javascript
room.join();
```

After that step you are in the conference. Now you can continue with adding some code that will handle the events and manage the conference.
