/**
 * Connects to the XMPP server using the specified credentials and contacts
 * Jicofo in order to obtain a session ID (which is then stored in the local
 * storage). The user's role of the parent conference will be upgraded to
 * moderator (by Jicofo). It's also used to join the conference when starting
 * from anonymous domain and only authenticated users are allowed to create new
 * rooms.
 *
 * @param {Object} options
 * @param {string} options.id - XMPP user's ID to log in. For example,
 * user@xmpp-server.com.
 * @param {string} options.password - XMPP user's password to log in with.
 * @param {Function} [options.onLoginSuccessful] - Callback called when logging
 * into the XMPP server was successful. The next step will be to obtain a new
 * session ID from Jicofo and join the MUC using it which will effectively
 * upgrade the user's role to moderator.
 * @returns {Object} A <tt>thenable</tt> which (1) settles when the process of
 * authenticating and upgrading the role of the specified XMPP user finishes and
 * (2) has a <tt>cancel</tt> method that allows the caller to interrupt the
 * process. If the process finishes successfully, the session ID has been stored
 * in the settings and the <tt>thenable</tt> is resolved. If the process
 * finishes with failure, the <tt>thenable</tt> is rejected with reason of type
 * {@link UpgradeRoleError} which will have either <tt>connectionError</tt> or
 * <tt>authenticationError</tt> property set depending on which of the steps has
 * failed. If <tt>cancel</tt> is called before the process finishes, then the
 * thenable will be rejected with an empty object (i.e. no error property will
 * be set on the rejection reason).
