/**
 * This class exports constants and factory methods related to the analytics
 * API provided by AnalyticsAdapter. In order for entries in a database to be
 * somewhat easily traceable back to the code which produced them, events sent
 * through analytics should be defined here.
 *
 * Since the AnalyticsAdapter API can be used in different ways, for some events
 * it is more convenient to just define the event name as a constant. For other
 * events a factory function is easier.
 *
 * A general approach for adding a new event:
 * 1. Determine the event type: track, UI, page, or operational. If in doubt use
 * operational.
 * 2. Determine whether the event is related to other existing events, and
 * which fields are desired to be set: name, action, actionSubject, source.
 * 3. If the name is sufficient (the other fields are not important), use a
 * constant. Otherwise use a factory function.
 *
 * Note that the AnalyticsAdapter uses the events passed to its functions for
 * its own purposes, and might modify them. Because of this, factory functions
 * should create new objects.
